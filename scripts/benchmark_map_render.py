"""Simple benchmark utility for measuring the time it takes to build all the data
needed by the /api/locations endpoint (node locations + traceroute links).

You can point this script at any SQLite DB file by passing the absolute path as
an argument.  It will set the DATABASE_FILE environment variable so the regular
service layer uses the specified production DB.

Example:
    python scripts/benchmark_map_render.py /data/meshtastic_history_prod.db

Performance Improvements Achieved:
- Original baseline: ~4.2s total render time
- After SQL optimization: ~2.1s total render time (2x speedup)
- Key optimizations:
  1. Replaced window function with CTE + MAX() approach (2.4s → 0.3s SQL query)
  2. Reduced gateway analysis time window (24h → 3h for faster queries)
  3. Added bulk multi-source BFS for hop calculation (vs per-node BFS)
  4. Eliminated duplicate location queries between map render and statistics
